**i am src-ry and i make very cool things that probably break prod and if you couldnt tell by now, im not very serious :trollface:**

im essentially just an internet user (:trollface:) who sometimes types things in a very annoying language (like typescript 😡!!!) and stuffs, so yeah!
* admittedly, this is just something i do for fun, so im not too very super serious on my profile so yeah
* my code is just like my life; held together by tape and glue!
